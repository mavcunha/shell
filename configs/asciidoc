# If you intend to process AsciiDoc files through an XML stage
# (such as a2x for manpage generation) you need to add something
# Like:
# 
#   export XML_CATALOG_FILES=/opt/homebrew/etc/xml/catalog
# 
# To your shell rc file so that xmllint can find AsciiDoc's
# Catalog files.
# 
# See `man 1 xmllint' for more.
